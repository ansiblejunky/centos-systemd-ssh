== centos-systemd-ssh

Docker image based on solita/centos-systemd adding sshd

*This image was developed for testing ansible and not for production
infrastructure!*

It runs a CentOS 7 Container with:

* systemd
* sshd
** Defaults to `vagrant` user with vagrant insecure key
* sudo

As such it is ideally suited for Ansible testing as a target host.

=== Usage:

Directly:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d \
    --name centos-systemd-ssh \
    -p 22:22 \ 
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    --tmpfs /run  \
    -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
    -t tonykay/centos-systemd-ssh
----

NOTE: Docker containers running systemd need additional privilege:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm --privileged -v /:/host tonykay/centos-systemd-ssh
----
=== Adding additional users

The image contains the _well known_ vagrant user and their key, however this can
easily be over-ridden.




=== Extras

A `ssh.cfg` is supplied for use with either *Ansible* or directly with ssh, e.g.

[source,bash]
----
ssh -F ssh.cfg localhost
----
